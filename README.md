This repository contains my final project for PHYS 381

My final PHYS 381 project will focus on the interactions between biological mechanisms and electromagnetism, which remains somewhat of a mystery. My project explores the radical-pair mechanism as a leading theory explaining how, for instance, migratory birds detect the Earth’s magnetic field for navigation. Although the biological basis of this magnetoreception remains partially unclear, research suggests that radical pairs—electron pairs formed in light-sensitive proteins like cryptochromes in birds’ eyes—respond to weak magnetic fields through spin dynamics that may influence orientation behavior.



The study aims to simulate the quantum dynamics of such radical pairs under various magnetic field conditions using Python-based tools (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib). The simulation tracks how an initial singlet spin state evolves over time due to Zeeman interactions (from external magnetic fields) and hyperfine coupling (interactions with nearby nuclear spins). The primary output is the singlet-state probability over time, under different magnetic field directions (z and x axes).



The key components of my project include:



Modeling the system Hamiltonian with relevant physical constants.



Simulating time evolution of the quantum state.



Analyzing how the magnetic field affects spin-state conversion.



Visualizing results to assess magnetic sensitivity in the model.
